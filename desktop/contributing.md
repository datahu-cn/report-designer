## Getting started

### Issues

Do not create issues about bumping dependencies unless a bug has been identified and you can demonstrate that it effects this library.

**Help us to help you**

Remember that weâ€™re here to help, but not to make guesses about what you need help with:

- Whatever bug or issue you're experiencing, assume that it will not be as obvious to the maintainers as it is to you.
- Spell it out completely. Keep in mind that maintainers need to think about _all potential use cases_ of a library. It's important that you explain how you're using a library so that maintainers can make that connection and solve the issue.

_It can't be understated how frustrating and draining it can be to maintainers to have to ask clarifying questions on the most basic things, before it's even possible to start debugging. Please try to make the best use of everyone's time involved, including yourself, by providing this information up front._

### Before creating an issue

Please try to determine if the issue is caused by an underlying library, and if so, create the issue there. Sometimes this is difficult to know. We only ask that you attempt to give a reasonable attempt to find out. Oftentimes the readme will have advice about where to go to create issues.

Try to follow these guidelines:
- **Investigate the issue** - Search for exising issues (open or closed) that address the issue, and might have even resolved it already.
- **Check the readme** - oftentimes you will find notes about creating issues, and where to go depending on the type of issue.
- Create the issue in the appropriate repository.

### Creating an issue

Please be as descriptive as possible when creating an issue. Give us the information we need to successfully answer your question or address your issue by answering the following in your issue:

- **description**: (required) What is the bug you're experiencing? How are you using this library/app?
- **OS**: (required) what operating system are you on?
- **version**: (required) please note the version of vite-electron-builder are you using
- **error messages**: (required) please paste any error messages into the issue, or a [gist](https://gist.github.com/)
- **extensions, plugins, helpers, etc** (if applicable): please list any extensions you're using


### Closing issues

The original poster or the maintainers of vite-electron-builder may close an issue at any time. Typically, but not exclusively, issues are closed when:

- The issue is resolved
- The project's maintainers have determined the issue is out of scope
- An issue is clearly a duplicate of another issue, in which case the duplicate issue will be linked.
- A discussion has clearly run its course
